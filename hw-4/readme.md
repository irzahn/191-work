I struggled as usual with learning code but I got the hang of some of it and its getting easier the more I mess arround with it.

I had problems with understanding where to putt the code and the variables and where they play.
I cant keep up in class so I record the lecture and take notes, but it doesnt seem to be working, so I have been watching a crap load of youtub videos to help me catch up a bit.
